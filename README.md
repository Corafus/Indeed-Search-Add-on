# Indeed-Search-Add-on
This application is meant to assist in using the job hunting site Indeed. You can use it search for multiple job titles in one search. You can also filter the results for multiple key phrases. And you can also search multiple cities at once. 

The current version is just to show one job will be found and data from the page will be saved to the user's hard drive. 

In the near future, the app will be able to do this for multiple jobs that are found. And the user will be able to enter their preferences into an excel document.
